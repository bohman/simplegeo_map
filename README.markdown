Simple Geo Map
==============

Simple Geo Map is a pluggable map for clustered display of positioned nodes. It's primarily intended for use with [simple_geo](http://github.com/hugowetterberg/simple_geo) and [simplegeo_api](http://github.com/hugowetterberg/simplegeo_api) but can easily be extended to support other sources.

This project is based on work of [Anders Fajerson (perifer)](http://github.com/perifer).
